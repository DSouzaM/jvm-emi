Like Soot, JaCoCo needed some custom patching to report coverage of bytecode offsets.
I reached out to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/jacoco/c/vW5y2Q8MkqQ/m/Kb9ij-eeAwAJ) and got some really helpful advice.
The patch of my changes is [here](https://gist.github.com/DSouzaM/a06393315c35fde3e9cd44cf283cd06f).
